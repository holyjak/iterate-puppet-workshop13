# Bug in VirtualBox causes that memory maped files are not updated when they change in a shared folder
# (http response has correct modified timestamp, size, ETag, but the file sent is the old one with bytes lost/added)
# => disable these functions
# See http://frankooh.wordpress.com/2011/01/21/vboxsf-and-small-files/ and https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/819
